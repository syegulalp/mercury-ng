                We've been home-brewing <a href="/writing/">science fiction and fantasy</a> since 2007. It's made by
                human hands, with a human touch. Even in the <a href="/vajra">biggest of adventures</a>, we look for the
                intimate details, the things that remind us that at the core of every great story are people we care
                about, not just neat ideas or nifty gizmos.

                Ever get that feeling you've <a href="/repairshop">read this story before</a>? So did we. That's why we
                sat down and started writing: to get out from under the shadow of mass-market, focus-grouped,
                demographically-predestined literature that's anything but "fantastic".
