<h1>FAQ: About Me</h1>
<hr />
<img class="amazon-img amazon-right" src="/img/serdar.jpg" alt="serdar.jpg" /><h2>Yes, it's real</h2>
<p>I get asked "Is <strong>Serdar Yegulalp </strong>your real name?" a lot. I answer, yes; some things are too offbeat to be made up. I usually also reply with an invitation to play a game: Try to guess where it's from. To my surprise, people guess in roughly the right geographic area &mdash; eastern Europe &mdash; but they almost never get it right on the first, or even the second or third, shot. (It's Turkey.)</p>
<p>I never imagined that having a name like that would get me into trouble without even trying, but that's more or less what happened when I first started using the Internet at large, as opposed to enclaves like AOL or CompuServe (where I got my start). Turned out I'd chosen to start posting to USENET right around the same time as the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdar_Argic">serdar-argic</a>, and my puzzlement as to why my posts weren't being acknowledged a good deal of the time led me to a quick-and-dirty lesson about killfiles and cancelbots. (<em>Needless to say, I am not "Serdar Argic", whoever he may be.</em>)</p>
<p>I could have changed it, I guess, but two things happened. One, I realized I was growing up in a generation where first names like "Trent", "Lokesh" and "Suji" were becoming more and more common; "Serdar" wasn't as huge a stretch anymore. (Yes, I think "Trent" is a funny name. I used to giggle at the word "Chicago", too.)</p>
<h2>The things we do for love (and money)</h2>
<p>Fortunately, in my case, they're nothing to be ashamed of. In 1994 I pounced at the chance to join the staff of <strong>Windows Magazine</strong>, owned by what was at the time CMP Media. I remained there until 2001, when the magazine was closed down, and loved every second of it.</p>
<p>From '01 through '07 I freelanced for a whole slew of different publications, mainly <strong>TechTarget.com</strong> and later on <strong>InformationWeek.</strong> The latter had the distinction of bring another CMP publication, and when they asked me to come on board at the end of '07, I realized I'd be coming right back home.</p>
<p>I left InformationWeek at the end of 2009, and was for a time the anime guide for the <strong>About.com </strong>family of sites. After filling that position for a few years, I created my own anime and Japanese pop-culture analysis site, <a href="http://www.ganriki.org"><strong>Ganriki</strong></a>. My current day job is with <strong>Infoworld, </strong>where I'm doing many of the same duties that I fulfilled at InformationWeek -- writing about information technology in business.</p>
<h2>The domain name(s)</h2>
<p>I didn't end up employing a pseudonym for USENET, but I did &mdash; sort of &mdash; for my web presence: <strong>The Gline. </strong>I didn't know <strong>gline</strong> was a term used on IRC; in fact, I'd pretty much come up with the handle at random by throwing together five letters at a time. I also didn't know <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vaughn%20bode">Vaughn Bode</a> had created an underground comic by the same name, written entirely in a kind of Nordic-Esperanto gibberish. Strange serendipity at work.</p>
<p>To that end, I registered and kept the domain name <strong>thegline.com</strong> for something like fourteen years. I used it as the generic label for everything that I worked on, from dabblings in music to writing to you-name-it. Over time, though, I realized the label was too generic: it was an empty container that was to be filled, cf. Richard Hell's comments about the Blank Generation, but it was <em>too</em> empty. It needed replacing.</p>
<p>I spent most of a day filling a blank notepad with ideas, mostly garnered from the fascinations in my life. From my longstanding love of things Japanese, I garnered <strong>Genji</strong>, along with the crest used by said clan during their reign. <strong>Press</strong> came from the nature of what I was doing. But since then my interests have grown past that one box, and I decided to rebrand with a name that seems more in line with a science-fiction-and-fantasy flavor:&nbsp;<strong>Infinimata</strong>.</p>
