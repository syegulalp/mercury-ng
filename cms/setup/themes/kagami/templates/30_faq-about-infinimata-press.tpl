<h1>FAQ: About Infinimata Press</h1><hr/>
<img class="pull-right" src="/img/design/infinimata_lg.png">
<h2>What is Infinimata Press, exactly?</h2>
<p>Infinimata Press is the personal publishing imprint for <a href="/faq/about-me">Serdar Yegulalp</a>, an &aelig;gis that I use for <a href="/writing">books</a> of my own creation.&nbsp;Everything that is published through Infinimata Press is from my own hands &mdash; not just the writing, but also the artwork, typesetting, layout, the whole package.</p>
<p>Originally, I was focused on writing and publishing books centering around Japan or Asia / the Far East in general, so I chose a name (<em>Genji Press</em>) that seemed fitting. But I decided another name was in order (<a href="/2019/02/change-in-the-wind.html">see this post for more context)</a>, and so I settled on&nbsp;<strong>Infinimata Press</strong> as something more suitable for an SF-and-fantasy imprint.</p>
<p><a href="/writing">Go here</a> for a quick rundown of what I have in print right now.</p>
<h2>Why did you start doing this?</h2>
<p>I started Infinimata Press for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted an outlet for my work where I had complete creative control, so I could publish what I liked without having to deal with the whims of the market or worrying about what would be popular or not.</li>
<li>I wanted to reach the audience of my choice directly, again without worrying about marketability.</li>
<li>I wanted to demonstrate that self-published work could be of high editorial, artistic and literary quality.</li>
<li>I wanted to have fun doing all of the above.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the advent of print-on-demand publishing, it's become not only possible but easy for me to make all this happen at minimal cost to myself. I can sell individual copies and still make a profit, although I do make a bit more if I manage to sell in volume.</p>
<h2>Are your books available through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, the Kindle store, etc.?</h2>
<p>Yes, depending on the editions. E-books have taken off to such a degree that I've decided to start marketing my newer work directly as e-books, with print editions as an adjunct via print-on-demand services.</p>
<h2>What happened to thegline.com and genjipress.com?</h2>
<p>Those were my old domain names. Over time I decided to phase them out, as the names really didn't tell people what I was all about (among other things). genjipress.com will continue to transparently redirect here for the time being.</p>
