<p>Aki was just a punk kid, but he had the <i>Split</i>—a flash of near-future insight that came only in moments of danger, and that let him see the way out of danger.</p>
<p>He wasn't alone, either. Yannick Seyrig had assembled a whole family, blood and otherwise, of Split-users like Aki. Under his wing, and with his guidance, they had the power to steal the world out from under everyone's feet.</p>
<p>Then one day the Seyrig family encountered the first disaster it didn't see coming. And when Aki found himself also facing dangers that even the Split couldn't ward off, he had to find a new family. One that could bring both his skills and theirs to a whole new level … and that could stop a heist where the score was nothing short of every possible future for the human race!</p>

<p>At first they were only three. A brilliant starship designer, haunted by the death of his loved ones. A spiritual leader whose faith could transform mankind ... or destroy it. A precocious acrobat girl, looking for a new family of her own.</p>
<p>Then came others. An entertainer and playboy whose dissolute lifestyle conceals unexpected ambitions, courtesy of a lover who represents the galaxy's most powerful worlds. And a pair of detectives — one barely human, the other not at all – with orders to enlist all their help solving a crime that threatens civilization.</p>
<p>Together they formed the crew of the ever-evolving spacecraft <em>Vajra</em>. Seven against a universe where the boundaries between matter and mind have been torn down, where one can wield the power of billions ... and where humanity must choose between rebirth or annihilation.</p>

<center><h2>A little something for everyone. Yes, you too.</h2></center>
<p>Infinimata Press isn't about focus groups or trends. It's about individual vision -- seeing only what one person can see, doing what only one person can do.
</p><p>From the warm human comedy of <i><a href="/writing/4dayweekend">The Four-Day Weekend</a></i> to the stylish slipstream fantasy of <a href="/summerworld"><em>Summerworld</em></a><em>, </em>the psychological twists of <em><a href="/fold">Welcome To The Fold</a></em>, the dark underworld of <em><a href="/writing/tokyoinferno/">Tokyo Inferno</a></em> and the far-future spectacle of <em><a href="/vajra">Flight of the Vajra</a></em>, there's nothing stamped from a mold here.
</p><p>We've got many new projects lined up for the future, and works from the past to be unearthed and added back in over time as well.</p>
<p>Learn more by visiting each book's subsite (linked above), or follow this page for updates on all new, future, and prior projects.</p>
